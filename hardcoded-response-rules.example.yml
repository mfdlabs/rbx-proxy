# Hardcoding responses is a bad practice, but sometimes it's necessary.

  method: "*" # Matches any method. If the method is not specified, this value will be inferred.
  scheme: "*" # Matches any scheme. If the scheme is not specified, this value will be inferred.
  statusCode: 200 # If not specified, defaults to 200
  body: { "hello": "world" } # If not specified, defaults to empty string

    # If not specified, defaults to empty map
